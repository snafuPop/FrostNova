# y'shtola Bot
Y'shtola Bot is a bot made for use with the VoIP platform [Discord](https://discordapp.com/). Features include an economy system, pulling information from select wikis and databases, and other fun commands.

## Getting Started
Simply [click here](https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=547516876851380293&permissions=1861483585&scope=bot) to invite Y'shtola to your server. You must have server permission to invite bots in order to see your server on the drop-down menu.

## Built With
- Python 3.5.x
- [Discord.py 1.0.0a (rewrite)](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/rewrite/)
- Hosted on [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com)

## Commands
Commands are invoked by typing in `!` followed by a command's name. Typing in `!help` will cause Y'shtola to direct message you a list of commands for you to browse. That list is dynamically updated based on the code and, therefore, will always be up to date.
